## Catalog (Milestone 1)

### Describe your Catalog (Milestone 1)
> What will your collection be about? What types of attributes will you keep track of for the *things* in your catalog? 1-2 sentences.

My collection will be a course catalog that displays the avalible courses for the Information science major and minor. It will list out courses by semester(fall/spring) and can also be arranged based on the classes that satisfy a specifc concentration. Furthermore, the class catalog can be organized by the amount of credits avaible and if it is a undergraduate or graduate class. Finally, it will display the status of the class whether it is open, closed, or waitlisted. It will also have a search bar option that will allow the user to search for a specific class.

The course catalog will state the class number, a description about the class, amount of credits and the current professor.
### Target Audience(s) (Milestone 1)
My target audience is focaused on Cornell University undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in the Information Science Major or minor. It is also targetted for students who have already declared the information science major and are looking to see which class are required to fufill their elective, concentration or major requirements.

### Design Patterns (Milestone 1)
1) I reviewed the Fairfield University course catalog. This catalog is organized by courses in alphabetical order A-Z. It is also organized by specific programs A-Z. There is also a catalog archive section as well as a calender. The course catalog is split between an undergraduate catalog and graduate catalog.

The design created by Faifield University will be useful when designing my catalog. I really liked how the courses were alphabetized making it easier to find a specific course. I really like how their were two separate course catalogs for graduate and undergraduate programs which I will take into consideration for my design iterations because I want to focus my target audience on both.

2) The Wellesley College catalog is organized by filters. These filters include a search button. It is also organized by semester, department/subject,faculty, meeting times, distribution cateogy and other. The user also has the option to show only the courses with automated wailists options or show only courses with seat reservations.

The design created by Wellesley College was organized very specific. The user can implement all of their information and the databse will compute the users specific requirements. I think that for my catalog I will create filters that will allow the user to find what they are looking for in a timely manner and address their specific needs instead of constantly scrolling.

3) The UNCONN course catalog is a little bit different. Once you click on a speicifc meajor it lists out all of the required classes. These classes are hyperlinked and can be clicked on by the user. Once clicked on the hyperlink it will take you directly to the location of the class in the course catalog. It describes the name, amount of creidts, prerequisites and some more information about the class.

The UNCONN catalog was unique but I think that the design is not very efficient. It takes a lot of clicking and going back to see which classes are need for a specific major. It is hard becasue when you click on a link it takes you to the entire catalog instead of one compiled catalog that is specific to your major. Overall, this was a unique catalog that showed variety.


## Design & Planning (Milestone 2)

## Design Process (Milestone 2)
> Document your design process. Show us the evolution of your design from your first idea (sketch) to design you wish to implement (sketch). Show us the process you used to organize content and plan the navigation, if applicable.
> Label all images. All labels must be visible in VS Code's Markdown Preview.
> Clearly label the final design.


## Partials (Milestone 2)
> If you have any partials, plan them here.


## Database Schema (Milestone 2)
> Describe the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture. A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this. Make sure you include constraints for each field.

Table: movies
- field 1: description..., constraints...
- field...


## Database Query Plan (Milestone 2)
> Plan your database queries. You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.]

1. All records

    ```
    TODO
    ```

2. Search records

    ```
    TODO
    ```

3. Insert record

    ```
    TODO
    ```


## Code Planning (Milestone 2)
> Plan any PHP code you'll need here.


# Reflection (Final Submission)
> Take this time to reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved since Project 1? What things did you have trouble with?
